"""
Assess protein folding stability during molecular dynamics.

A molecular dynamics simulation is run for each of a set of small proteins
starting from their native (folded) conformation, and the ability of the model
to keep each protein folded is measured along the trajectory via the RMSD,
TM score, and radius of gyration relative to the reference structure.
